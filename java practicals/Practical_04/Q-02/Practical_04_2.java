/* *OutPut:

    11

Explanation:
    The code creates two objects, b and c, of classes SuperB and SubC respectively.

    For object b:
        The setIt() method sets x to 2.
        The increase() method increments x by 1.
        The triple() method multiplies x by 3.
        The value of x is printed, resulting in the output 9.

    For object c:
        The setIt() method sets x to 2.
        The increase() method increments x by 1.
        The triple() method in SubC adds 3 to x.
        The value of x is printed, resulting in the output 11.
